## TrackPatrol üõ°Ô∏è

TrackPatrol is our solution to the problem statement given by the Bureau of Police Research & Development (BPR&D)|Ministry of Education (MoE) to track police personnel deployed on Bandobast Duties.
It has a Dashboard for assigning, managing, monitoring Bandobast duties, and generating reports.
It has an App for tracking real-time location and giving notifications. 
Trackpatrol enables the registration, management, and attachment of various hardware such as UHF RFID and biometric scanners to further increase police personnel monitoring.
